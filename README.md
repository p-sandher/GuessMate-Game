<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this React Native and Expo-based project, I implemented a number-guessing game where users choose a number, and the application intelligently guides them to the correct answer. Leveraging React Native components, I employed state management to track the user's selected number and dynamically adjust the displayed content based on whether their guess is higher or lower than the actual number. The app utilizes conditional rendering to present feedback messages, providing an interactive and engaging user experience. The logic behind the game involves efficient algorithms for narrowing down the possible range of numbers and updating the UI accordingly. Additionally, the project showcases the seamless integration of React Native and Expo for cross-platform mobile development.
